            <h2>LEAKY BUCKET ALGORITHM</h2>
            <p>Suppose we have a bucket in which we are pouring water, at random points in time, 
                but we have to get water at a fixed rate, to achieve this we will make a hole at the 
                bottom of the bucket. This will ensure that the water coming out is at some fixed rate, 
                and also if the bucket gets full, then we will stop pouring water into it. The input rate
                 can vary, but the output rate remains constant. Similarly, in networking,
                  a technique called leaky bucket can smooth out bursty traffic. 
                  Bursty chunks are stored in the bucket and sent out at an average rate.</p>

            <h2>TOKEN BUCKET ALGORITHM</h2>
            <p>The leaky bucket algorithm enforces output patterns at the average rate, 
                no matter how busy the traffic is. So, to deal with the more traffic,
                 we need a flexible algorithm so that the data is not lost. 
                 One such approach is the token bucket algorithm.
                Let us understand this algorithm step wise as given below :
                In regular intervals tokens are thrown into the bucket. The bucket has a maximum capacity. 
                If the packet is ready, then a token is removed from the bucket, and the packet is sent.  
                Suppose, if there is no token in the bucket, the packet cannot be sent.</p>
